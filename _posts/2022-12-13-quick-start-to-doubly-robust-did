# What is Doubly Robust?

In our first introduction to Causal Inference, we learned about difference-in-differences and propensity score weighting to estimate the average treatment effect conditional on covariates.

Covariates are the main cause of counfoundness in causal inference settings, so the question arises what method should I use? Which one is the best method? Actually, you can use both to guarantee unbiased estimators.
