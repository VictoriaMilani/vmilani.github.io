Here is a collection of open thoughts I had during these years as a Ph.D. student. Think of these as my personal notes that helped me understand important concepts from economics and econometrics literature.

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <h2><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
      {{ post.excerpt }}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
