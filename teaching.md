## Causal Inference: The Mixtape by [Scott Cunningham](http://www.scunning.com)

During my masterâ€™s, I collaborated with Dr. Scott Cunningham to translate all causal inference models in his textbook, Causal Inference: The Mixtape, from Stata to R. I developed the code for accessibility, making it clear for both graduate and undergraduate students. This experience quickly made me familiarized with many causal inference tools typical in economics.
