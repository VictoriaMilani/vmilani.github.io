There are many things in our lives that are strictly positive. For example, how many hours do you spend reading a book? I am certainly it is at least zero. Nobody reads minus two hours of books per day.

This is the essence of the bunching principle: sometimes, supposedly continuous variables exhibit a spike of positive probability concentration at a point. In the above example, one _may or may not_ read in their free time, but if they read, the time spent behaves as a continuous variable.
