I am **Hugo Sant'Anna**, a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu/), in the [John Munro Godfrey, Sr. Department of Economics](https://www.terry.uga.edu/economics/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Labor Economics** and **Applied Econometrics**, where I examine how large-scale disruptions reshape labor market structures, with a focus on immigration flows, environmental crises, and gender dynamics.

I also study methodological challenges in settings where covariates may be influenced by treatment effects in Difference-in-Differences.
