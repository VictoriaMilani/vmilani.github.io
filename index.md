I am **Hugo Sant'Anna**, a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu/), [John Munro Godfrey, Sr. Department of Economics](https://www.terry.uga.edu/economics/).

My research interests are **labor economics** and **applied econometrics**. I am particularly interested in how labor market features shape wages, including gender and immigration.

  <strong>My paper The Effects of the Venezuelan Refugee Crisis on the Brazilian Labor Market got an R&R in the Journal of Economic Geography!</strong>

In my job market paper, I employ a Gaussian mixture model on a large administrative data to measure how worker-firm assortativity affects the gender wage gap. [[details](/workingpapers/assortmatch)]

---

In my second year paper, I employ a doubly robust DID model on administrative data to show how complementarity between formal and the informal markets can positively and negatively affect wages. (R&R @ JEG) [[details](/workingpapers/vzcrisis)]

---

I am also working on a more theoretical econometrics paper to provide imputation methods to covariates that may be affected by treatment. [[details](/workingpapers/badcontrols)]

I will be on the **2024/2025 job market**. My <a href="files/hsantannaCV.pdf">CV</a>.
