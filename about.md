![Ipanema Beach's Winter Sunset](/assets/images/ipanema.jpg)
I am from the beautiful city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This photo shows Ipanema Beach during a winter sunset, taken on my last visit. 

Rio has undoubtedly been a major influence on my enthusiasm for economics.

I am also a huge fan of history, cooking, and physics. When I am not doing research, I am probably in my kitchen making an experimental dish. My favorite cuisines are Portuguese, Italian, Korean, and, of course, Brazilian!
