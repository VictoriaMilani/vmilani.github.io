  <strong>My paper The Effects of the Venezuelan Refugee Crisis on the Brazilian Labor Market got an R&R in the Journal of Economic Geography!</strong>

**Welcome!** I am **Hugo Sant'Anna**, a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu/), [John Munro Godfrey, Sr. Department of Economics](https://www.terry.uga.edu/economics/).


I am a labor economist with focus on applied econometrics. My research interests are Immigration and Gender in the Labor Market, and Difference-in-differences Applications. In my job market paper, I use a large administrative data, and clustering and mixture algorithms to measure the contribution of assortativity between workers and firms to the gender wage gap.

I will be on the 2024/2025 job market.
